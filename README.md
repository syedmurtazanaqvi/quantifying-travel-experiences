# ✈️ Quantifying Travel Experiences with Data Science
A data science project ranking cities based on personal travel experience factors like natural beauty, food, affordability, and safety — using Python, Streamlit, and interactive visualizations.

> *“Some cities leave you breathless. Some fill your soul. But how do you measure that?”*

In 2025, I embarked on a personal journey — ten cities, ten different worlds. From the misty mountains of Islamabad to the neon flow of Tokyo, I felt wonder, discomfort, connection, curiosity. But as a data scientist in the making, I asked myself:

**Can I make sense of what made each city feel so unique or similar?**

This project is my attempt to answer that — not with vague memories, but with **structured analysis**, **interactive visuals**, and a bit of **math-powered storytelling**.

## 🌏 The Cities

- Islamabad 🇵🇰
- Lahore 🇵🇰
- Beijing 🇨🇳 
- Wuhan 🇨🇳  
- Chongqing 🇨🇳  
- Chengdu 🇨🇳  
- Tokyo 🇯🇵  
- Osaka 🇯🇵  
- Kyoto 🇯🇵    
- Bangkok 🇹🇭    

Each one is scored across 8 experiential factors:

| Factor                | Why It Matters                                           |
|---------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌿 Natural Beauty     | Because nature is where we were born to be               |
| 🍜 Food               | Culture you don’t have to translate                      |
| 🎭 Cultural Vibe      | Art, architecture, language — the feel of a city         |
| 💸 Affordability      | Not everyone is financially gifted, including me         |
| 🧼 Cleanliness        | Air, water, streets — it all adds up                     |
| 🤝 Hospitality        | The warmth of strangers which makes you feel at home     |
| 🛡️ Safety             | Feeling free, not fearful                                |
| 🔁 Revisit Likelihood | Would I choose to return? The ultimate decisive factor   |

## 🧠 How I Scored It

From taking interviews from locals and social media to extracting real data from: 
🌐 Google reviews, 🌍 TripAdvisor insights, 💬 Reddit sentiment, and 🧾 price indices from Numbeo. This was my best approach to eliminate personal bias and keep it as objective as possible.

---

## 🧮 The Model

A **customisable weighted average** allows different priorities to shine.  
You value food over safety? Dial it up. Prefer affordability over art? Go ahead.

All rankings update in real time in the dashboard.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Beauty isn’t just in the eye of the beholder — it’s also in the data.
- Travel can be emotional, but data helps you understand your emotions.
- Building this app taught me how to transform experience into insight — a skill I aim to bring into real-world data science challenges.
